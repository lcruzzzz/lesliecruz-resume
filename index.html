        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi everyone my name is Leslie Cruz Hernandez. I am a third year student at the University of California Riverside. I am an Education major with a concentration in Social Justice, Leadership and Policy. I am from Northern California, more specifically Sonoma County. Back home I have work experience with the City of Santa Rosa, Recreation and Parks, with the Neighborhood Services division. The objective of their programs is to help low income families and prevent gang violences in neighborhoods that have high crime rates.The city also tries to give these children positive role models (the staff) that can also help lead them on the right path. I have worked for my City since I was 16,( I am now 21) so I have a lot of experience. Between their COVID program named School of Rec, to Summer Camps, Afterschool Programs, Sports programs, Thanksgiving Camp, Winter Camps, Spring Break Camps and so much more! However, my most recent experience is listed down below. 
<br><br>

        One program I was lead staff for was a  program we had during the first year of COVID (2020-2021). The program was called School of Rec, the participants would be there from 7:30 am-5pm. During that time we would help the students log into zoom, complete their home and lead different activities. It was like helping the students through a school day and still doing like an after school program in one. Since I was lead staff I would also be in charge of overseeing two other staff members, help make our schedule for the day and be in charge if anything were to occur. 

Another program that I oversaw as assistant director was our summer camp (Summer 2021). We had about 60 participants because of COVID and did different activities including sports. Which included art projects, academic activities and swimming. 

In addition, my experience was an After School Program. The after school programs are located in low income apartments in order to help provide support for families in need of academic support but do not have the funds to put them in expensive programs. We help students with homework, reading and develop life skills. 

<br><br>

        This last summer I also oversaw our Summer Camp (summer 2022). As the camp director. I helped manage day to day operations of the camp. Including assigning staff roles and responsibilities and helping with behavioral obstacles from the youth. I was also primarily in charge of communicating with office staff and keeping them in the loop of any materials needed, any big staff/participant issues and any events that we were planning on having throughout the summer. 

Lastly, my most recent experience has been working from home with the City of Santa Rosa. Luckily, since I moved to Riverside due to school, they granted me permission to work virtually. I have worked planning art activities for the After School Programs, Camps and so much more. This has been a great opportunity since this is something that normally do not do!
